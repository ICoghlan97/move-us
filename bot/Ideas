Calorie Counter:
    So, when someone joins the chat it will start and every exercise will have the average calories burnt for each exercise. So the 1st of every month a leaderboard will be shared in the discord to show everyones calories burnt for that month. 1st place gets ___ xp, 2nd place get ___ xp ect...

Leveling:
    Each month the leaderboard will be released and xp wil be stored for a players discord account in a data base.
